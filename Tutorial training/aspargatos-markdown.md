asparagus is healthy and tasty.

> but it has side effects to eat it which are weird smell wise at least for some of us.

*asparagus is fascinating*
**and yummy a lot!! Especially with butter or ham and mayonnaise.**

**People _should_ eat more asparagus.**
 
 1. asparagus is best long and broad and fresh
 
 2. peeled by oneself
 
 3. boils just long enough but not too long
 
 4. and eaten in springtime
 
 So the idea would be to eat asparagus and have some `great light and mineral white wine`with it and `fresh potatoes`
