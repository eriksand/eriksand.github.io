###  @Erik's audio guidelines

####  General

*  The game will probably not be played with incredible sound systems.
*  With laptop speakers you will not be able to hear low pitch sounds very well
*  With laptop speakers you will not be able to hear volume variation very well.
*  Avoid distortion.

####  Recording sound

*  You can use Audacity to record
*  Get the best microphone you can find :)
*  Make sure you don't get a clipping sound (distortion) in the original file
*  (Don't follow the example of the ouch.wav audio I put in the audio folder)
*  Distortion occurs when the volume is above the capacity of the recording device
*  You can use a limiter, but I think the sound will be better if you don't
*  Mind the distance to the microphone will have a huge impact on the sound. If you double your distance, volume will be 4 times lower

####  Editing sound

*  Recommended tool: Audacity. With it you can compress sound and check levels
*  [This explains a little about playing sounds simultaniously in a game](http://answers.unity3d.com/questions/627599/controlling-audio-clipping-and-distortion-on-multi.html)
*  Basically if we play a lot of sounds at the same time, the volume will be too high and we will get clipping.
*  I don't know what will be a good level, but I expect we can count with around 4 simultanious sounds plus music
*  I think we could try to have the sounds at max -9 to start with.
*  If the audio has a peak, but the rest is very low you can try compressing it (Not explaining that here)
*  If it sounds unnatural and wierd after that, rerecord it.
