## My very own worklog

*  Soo, I have created a branch, I think that was what I was supposed to do.
*  Now I'm creating a worklog according to the instructions of the boss
*  I have also finished my cinnamon buns, and I'm waiting for a guest to arrive, so we can start eating! They smell great!

*  New day, reformatted this worklog so it should be in markdown
*  Created an issue about the formatting about this document and added some spacing to make it looka nice :)
*  Seems to be working, thanks Michael
