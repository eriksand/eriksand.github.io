* what is exactly a source code? Help to translate human language into machine language, text of a computer program, abstractly its a software document.

> Source code is the code that whatever interpreter reads, it's the "source" where everything comes from.

* What is Github superficially? same as sourceforce just emphasizing social aspects more and using forks and branches as tools for colaboration.

> Github is a website where Git repositories are shown graphically. The social functionality they have added is very nice.

* What is software? Its superficially kinda commanding hardware.

> Yes

* Programming? the acticity of designing and implementing computer programes.

* Compiler? Its a computer program which translates the language of a differenr computer program into a language the computer understands. Like a mediator in conflict situations a bit.

> A compiler is not really a program. But the translation part is fairly correct. Most compilers compile a certain language to C, which most computers understand by default.

* htmlbeginnerdogape done! It was exciting. :)
